## Abstract

arXiv:2606.28363v1  [cs.IR]  5 Apr 2026

Objective: To describe the architecture and design rationale of meta-pipe, an open-source large language model (LLM)-agent pipeline that integrates the complete systematic review and meta-analysis (SR/MA) workflow — from literature search through statistical analysis, manuscript generation, and quality assurance — with mandatory human oversight at critical decision points.

Study Design and Setting: We developed a 10-stage modular pipeline integrating Claude (Anthropic; Opus 4 for reasoning, Haiku 3.5 for classification) for LLM-assisted screening and extraction, Python (~3,600 lines of code) for automation, R (meta, metafor, gemtc, netmeta) for statistical analysis, and Quarto for manuscript rendering. Five mandatory human decision points enforce oversight. We systematically com- pared meta-pipe’s capabilities with five existing SR automation tools based on published documentation as of March 2026.


## Results:

meta-pipe offers four capabilities not available in any single existing tool:
automated
manuscript generation from analysis outputs, semi-automated GRADE assessment, overclaim detection (12
predefined patterns), and dual-paradigm network meta-analysis (Bayesian and frequentist). Estimated API
cost is $15–30 per typical 5–10 study review. No validation data are reported; this is a system description,
not a validation study.

Conclusion: End-to-end AI-assisted evidence synthesis is architecturally feasible as an open-source tool with mandatory human oversight. Formal validation reproducing published Cochrane reviews is underway and essential before routine use.

Keywords: systematic review, meta-analysis, large language model, automation, evidence synthesis, artificial intelligence


## 1. Introduction

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses (SR/MA) are resource-intensive: traditional reviews require ap- proximately 1,100 person-hours [1, 2] and 67 weeks [3], with the most efficient reported workflow requiring 61 person-hours [4]. Several automation tools address this burden. Covidence extends screening to extraction [5]; TrialMind combines search, screening, and extraction [6]; otto-SR automates screening through meta-analysis [7]; and Nested Knowledge covers SR through network meta-analysis [8]. A scoping review of 37 studies found LLM approaches covered 10 of 13 SR steps but concluded they are “not yet ready for standalone use” [9]. The three uncovered steps were protocol development, certainty of evidence assessment, and interpretation — the latter two of which meta-pipe addresses.

Despite this progress, no open-source tool integrates statistical analysis, manuscript generation, and quality assurance as a unified pipeline. To address this gap, we developed meta-pipe, an open-source LLM- agent pipeline orchestrating the complete SR/MA workflow across 10 stages with five mandatory human

decision points. As a system description — not a validation study — this paper contributes: (1) the pipeline architecture with standardized data contracts; (2) automated manuscript generation from meta- analytic outputs; (3) a quality assurance layer (GRADE assessment and overclaim detection); and (4) a systematic comparison with five existing tools. Formal validation reproducing published Cochrane reviews is underway separately.


## 2. Methods

2.1. Pipeline Architecture

meta-pipe comprises 10 sequential stages (Table 1), each implemented as a self-contained skill module with defined inputs, outputs, and quality thresholds. Each skill module is a structured prompt docu- ment containing workflow guidance, command references, validation criteria, and input/output specifica- tions (Supplementary S2). Inter-stage data contracts specify file schemas at each boundary: BibTeX for bibliography records, CSV for screening and extraction data, JSON for configuration, and Quarto mark- down for manuscript components (Supplementary S3). Schema validation is currently documentation-based; programmatic enforcement is planned.

Human decision points are embedded at five junctures: (1) PICO definition and eligibility criteria; (2) screening disagreement resolution; (3) analysis type selection (pairwise vs network meta-analysis); (4) GRADE quality assessment; and (5) interpretation and clinical implications. These gates retain human judgment where domain expertise is essential, consistent with consensus that AI should augment rather than replace human reviewers [9, 10].

2.2. Technology Stack

The pipeline integrates four technologies: (a) Claude [11] (Anthropic) for LLM orchestration — using Opus 4 with extended thinking for complex reasoning tasks (screening adjudication, risk-of-bias assessment, manuscript generation) and Haiku 3.5 for high-throughput simple tasks (title/abstract classification, data validation) — introducing a commercial API dependency that affects reproducibility, cost, and availability; portability to other LLMs (GPT-4, Gemini, Llama) has not been tested; prompt versioning is partially implemented; (b) Python (~3,600 lines of code) for data processing, LLM-assisted screening and extraction, validation, and quality assurance, managed via uv with lock files; (c) R for statistical analysis: meta v8.0 [12], metafor v4.8 [13], gemtc v1.0 [14], and netmeta v3.4 [15], with package versions locked via renv; and (d) Quarto for manuscript rendering to HTML, DOCX, and PDF with validated cross-references and citations.

2.3. Search and Screening (Stages 01–03)

Literature searches use PubMed and Scopus by default, with optional extension to Embase and the Cochrane Library. The default selection does not include CENTRAL or Embase, standard requirements for Cochrane-compliant reviews; this is acknowledged as a limitation. Search strategies are LLM-drafted based on the PICO definition and require mandatory expert review and refinement before execution.

Title and abstract screening employs a test-retest reliability approach: the LLM performs two indepen- dent screening passes at temperature 0.3, and agreement is quantified using Cohen’s kappa [16]. We use “test-retest reliability” rather than “inter-rater agreement” because both passes use the same model with the same training data; this measures screening decision stability under stochastic decoding variation, not independent assessment quality. The minimum kappa threshold is 0.60 (moderate agreement per Landis and Koch), below Cochrane’s 0.80 for dual review. Because test-retest kappa measures intra-model stabil- ity rather than inter-rater reliability, the 0.80 benchmark is not directly applicable: kappa below 0.60 at temperature 0.3 indicates prompt ambiguity or insufficiently specific PICO criteria requiring human review. This approach does not substitute for independent dual review as recommended by PRISMA 2020.

2

2.4. Data Extraction and Risk of Bias (Stages 04–05)

Full-text retrieval uses Unpaywall API integration with manual fallback. PDF documents are processed by passing full text to the LLM context window; the pipeline cannot reliably extract from figures, supplemen- tary materials, or complex multi-page tables. Data extraction employs structured templates with automated validation (range checks, consistency verification, confidence scoring). Confidence scores are LLM-generated and uncalibrated; they serve as triage rather than validated accuracy metrics. Specific failure modes include extracting from wrong tables, confusing intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations, and misidentifying primary endpoints. This deviates from PRISMA 2020 Item 11d, which recommends at least two independent extractors.

Risk of bias is assessed using RoB 2 (randomized trials) or ROBINS-I (observational studies) with LLM- assisted domain-level judgment and mandatory human review.

2.5. Statistical Analysis (Stage 06)

Pairwise meta-analyses use REML random-effects models with Hartung-Knapp adjustment for confidence intervals. Heterogeneity is quantified using I2, Cochran’s Q, and prediction intervals. Publication bias is assessed using funnel plots, Egger’s/Peters’ tests, and trim-and-fill analysis [17]; the pipeline warns when k < 10. Sensitivity analyses include leave-one-out analysis and influence diagnostics.

Network meta-analysis uses a dual-paradigm approach: Bayesian (gemtc [14] with MCMC) and frequen- tist (netmeta [15]). Discordance — defined as reversed top-three treatment rankings or point estimates differing by >0.2 SMD or odds ratio ratio >1.5 — triggers closer examination. These are pragmatic author- chosen thresholds informed by conventional effect size benchmarks, not formally calibrated.

2.6. Manuscript Generation and Quality Assurance (Stages 07–09)

Manuscript assembly uses Quarto templates for each IMRaD (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Dis- cussion) section, reading effect estimates directly from R output files to prevent hallucination of statistical results. This capability is unique among current SR automation tools.

Quality assurance comprises PRISMA 2020 checklist validation (27 items), semi-automated GRADE assessment (with mandatory human review), and automated overclaim detection scanning for 12 predefined patterns of unsupported claims (Supplementary S4). The pipeline implements stage-level checkpointing for re-execution from any failure point; API failures trigger exponential-backoff retry for up to three attempts.


## 3. Results

3.1. Pipeline Implementation

The pipeline comprises 12 skill modules (10 primary stage modules plus 2 utility modules for project setup and configuration), 24 Python automation scripts (~3,600 lines of code), 5 R analysis scripts, and 74 methodology reference documents. The source code is available under the MIT license (repository URL and Zenodo DOI to be added upon acceptance).

3.2. Unique Capabilities

Four capabilities distinguish meta-pipe from existing tools (Table 2). First, manuscript generation: meta-pipe is the only SR automation tool producing structured IMRaD manuscripts directly from analysis outputs, with effect estimates read from R files to prevent hallucination. Second, GRADE assessment: semi- automated domain-level suggestions (risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, publication bias) requiring mandatory human adjudication; no other tool offers this. Third, overclaim detection: automated scanning for 12 predefined patterns of unsupported claims, though precision and recall have not been formally evaluated. Fourth, dual-paradigm NMA: Bayesian (gemtc) and frequentist (netmeta) concordance checks, tested with synthetic data but not yet exercised on a real clinical review.

3.3. Feature Comparison


> **Table 2 compares meta-pipe with five existing SR/MA tools based on published documentation as of**

> March 2026. Each tool excels within its scope; meta-pipe’s positioning is best understood through its unique
contributions — open-source end-to-end coverage, manuscript generation, quality assurance, and GRADE
— rather than breadth claims.
We do not claim superiority in screening or extraction accuracy, as we
have no component-level validation data. otto-SR’s reproduction of 12 Cochrane reviews [7] represents a
validation standard that meta-pipe has not yet achieved.

3.4. Cost Estimate

API costs are estimated at $15–30 per typical 5–10 study pairwise meta-analysis. These are theoretical projections based on Claude API token pricing, not empirical measurements. The approximate per-stage breakdown is: screening ~$2–5, extraction ~$8–18 (driven by full-text PDF processing), risk-of-bias ~$2–4, and manuscript generation ~$1–3. Statistical analysis incurs minimal LLM costs. Cost scaling beyond 50 studies has not been characterized; per-stage token logging is planned for the validation study.


## 4. Discussion

4.1. Principal Findings

This paper describes the architecture and design rationale of meta-pipe, an open-source pipeline covering all 10 SR/MA stages. The contribution is architectural, not empirical: we have not demonstrated that the pipeline produces accurate outputs; that evidence must come from the planned Cochrane reproduction study. What we have shown is that end-to-end AI-assisted evidence synthesis is technically feasible as an open-source tool with mandatory human oversight.

4.2. Comparison with Existing Tools

meta-pipe complements rather than competes with existing tools (Table 2). Its core differentiators — open-source end-to-end scope, manuscript generation, GRADE assessment, and overclaim detection — address capabilities not available in any single existing tool. Users can achieve similar coverage by chaining tools (e.g., Covidence for screening, R for analysis, manual manuscript writing), but meta-pipe’s value lies in integrated data flow and quality gates that reduce manual transfer steps.

Concurrent with our work, Cao et al. presented otto-SR, an agentic LLM pipeline that reproduced 12 Cochrane reviews with 96.7% screening sensitivity and 93.1% extraction accuracy [7]. Where otto-SR optimizes for full automation, meta-pipe targets de novo synthesis with human decision points, additionally covering NMA, manuscript generation, and GRADE. The critical difference is evidentiary: otto-SR has demonstrated that its pipeline works; meta-pipe has described an architecture that could work. Several caveats apply: otto-SR is a preprint using LLM-as-judge evaluation and does not report cost data; however, its quantitative concordance metrics represent a validation standard meta-pipe has not achieved.

4.3. Human Oversight and Reproducibility

The five mandatory human gates align with the Cochrane 2025 AI position statement [10] and developing RAISE guidelines [18]. We acknowledge a tension: otto-SR’s results suggest full automation can outperform humans on individual tasks. The human gates are thus better understood as trust-building mechanisms for novel research questions — where no gold-standard review exists — rather than proven quality improvements. Whether human oversight improves or degrades overall pipeline accuracy is an empirical question for the validation study.

Reproducibility is supported by renv (R) and uv (Python) lock files, but LLM outputs are inherently stochastic and model deprecation by commercial providers remains unresolved. The “open source” claim warrants qualification: pipeline code is public, but the Claude API backbone is proprietary; portability to alternative LLMs has not been tested.

4

4.4. Error Propagation

In a 10-stage sequential pipeline, errors compound: a screening false negative eliminates studies from all downstream analyses. Under naïve independence assumptions, 95% per-stage accuracy yields only 60% end-to-end — though this substantially overstates the problem because human decision points correct errors, many errors are non-compounding (a misclassified study is simply absent rather than introducing correlated downstream errors), and R-based statistical stages do not introduce LLM errors. Formal error propagation analysis — empirical or theoretical — is needed to characterize reliability.

4.5. Limitations

Methodological: no validation data (the essential next step); LLM screening is test-retest, not PRISMA 2020 dual review; extraction confidence scores are uncalibrated; no systematic failure mode documentation. Technical: commercial API dependency affecting cost, privacy, and reproducibility; partially implemented prompt versioning; untested LLM portability; NMA and overclaim detection not validated on real clinical reviews. Scope: programming skill barrier (R, Python, command line); English-language literature only; default databases (PubMed, Scopus) exclude CENTRAL and Embase, falling short of Cochrane search requirements.

4.6. Conclusions

meta-pipe demonstrates that open-source, end-to-end AI-assisted SR/MA is architecturally feasible when designed with mandatory human oversight and automated quality gates. Its unique capabilities — manuscript generation from analysis outputs, semi-automated GRADE assessment, overclaim detection, and dual-paradigm NMA — are not available in any single existing tool. Formal validation reproducing pub- lished Cochrane reviews is the essential next step. We invite independent groups to validate meta-pipe and encourage the development of interoperability standards that would allow users to combine the strongest components of different SR automation tools.

4.14. S5. Feature Comparison Methodology The feature comparison in Table 2 was constructed as follows:

1. Source identification: For each tool, we identified the primary peer-reviewed publication, official documentation website, and most recent user guides (accessed January–March 2026). 2. Feature classification: Features were classified as AI-assisted (bold) when the tool uses machine learning or LLM automation for that stage, supported (plain text) when the tool provides templates, forms, or manual workflows, or absent (dash) when the feature is not available. 3. Verification: Two authors independently classified features for each tool. Disagreements were resolved by consulting the tool’s documentation. 4. Limitations: This comparison reflects published capabilities and may not capture unreleased fea- tures, beta functionality, or recent updates. Commercial tools may have added capabilities since our assessment date. 5. Validation evidence: Validation claims are based on the strongest published evidence (peer-reviewed > preprint > internal reports > no published evidence).
