## Abstract

SLR Title: Inhaled corticosteroids for bronchiectasis Research Question: What is the efficacy and safety of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in [...] bronchiectasis [...]? Inclusion Criterion: Types of outcome measures: change in objective measures of lung function

The scientific literature is growing rapidly, mak- ing it hard to keep track of the state-of-the-art. Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) aim to identify and evaluate all relevant papers on a topic. After retrieving a set of candidate papers, the abstract screening phase determines initial relevance. To date, abstract screening methods using large language models (LLMs) focus on binary classification settings; existing question- answering (QA) based ranking approaches suf- fer from error propagation. LLMs offer a unique opportunity to evaluate the SLR’s inclu- sion and exclusion criteria, yet, existing bench- marks do not provide them exhaustively. We manually extract these criteria as well as re- search questions for 57 SLRs, mostly in the medical domain, enabling principled compar- isons between approaches. Moreover, we pro- pose LGAR, a zero-shot LLM-Guided Abstract Ranker composed of an LLM-based graded relevance scorer and a dense re-ranker. Our extensive experiments show that LGAR out- performs existing QA-based methods by 5-10 pp. in mean average precision. Our code and data is publicly available.1

approaches focus on facilitating the selection of relevant articles, one of the most time-consuming steps (van Dinter et al., 2021). Large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented means and zero-shot capabilities for interpreting text in com- plex retrieval and ranking scenarios such as abstract screening, where a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria and research questions have to be compared to an abstract. Recent studies suggest that meth- ods based on LLMs can reduce up to 60-70% of the workload necessary for paper selection in the abstract screening phase of SLRs (thi Tran et al., 2023; Sandner et al., 2024).

1 Introduction

The scientific literature grows rapidly, by an esti- mated average of roughly 7% per year over the past 22 years (Oliveira et al., 2022), with 3.3 million ar- ticles having appeared worldwide in 2022 (Schnei- der, 2023). Keeping track of the state-of-the-art of a particular research topic is hence inherently diffi- cult. Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) are an academic standard of investigating the current state- of-the-art in a specific field. They follow a strict protocol (e.g., Kitchenham and Brereton (2013)). Since conducting SLRs is typically very expen- sive and time-consuming (Michelson and Reuter, 2019), efforts have been made to automate vari- ous parts of the process. Most existing automation

Due to the difficulty of leveraging LLMs for ranking in a scalable manner (Zhu et al., 2023), almost all prior work on abstract screening with LLMs works in a binary classification setting, re- fraining from inducing a ranking of candidate pa- pers. In practice, a ranked list is much more useful, because the decision of the cut-off point can be left

2 Background and Related Work

to the human user flexibly. The only existing LLM- based ranker (Akinseloyin et al., 2024)2 generates questions for SLR criteria and generates answers for each abstract. The answers are converted to nu- meric scores using a sentiment classifier, extended with embedding-based similarities, and averaged. While promising, this pipeline-based approach suf-

This section provides a brief overview of SLR au- tomation with a focus on abstract screening. SLR automation. In the first stage of an SLR a set of candidate papers is retrieved from scien- tific databases, typically using Boolean queries. The automatic formulation of these queries based on review protocol text has been approached us- ing semantic parsing (Alharbi et al., 2018; Scells et al., 2020b,c), rank fusion (Scells et al., 2020a), and LLM-based generation (Wang et al., 2023b,a). SLRs have also been supported by applying sum- marization methods (Bui et al., 2016) and by ex- tracting fine-grained entity types and relations (Panayi et al., 2023). Most active learning (AL) tools for SLR automation use traditional machine learning (ML), e.g., AS Review (van de Schoot et al., 2021), Abstrackr (Wallace et al., 2012), Colandr (Cheng et al., 2018), FASTREAD (Yu et al., 2018), Rayyan (Ouzzani et al., 2016), or RobotAnalyst (Przybyła et al., 2018). Carvallo and Parra (2019) compare neural classifiers in an AL setup. AL assumes substantial training data. In contrast, we focus on zero-shot settings. Abstract screening. Early approaches for binary relevance classification for abstract screening apply traditional ML techniques (Kim and Choi, 2014; Khabsa et al., 2016; Matwin et al., 2010; Matwin and Sazonova, 2012). Qin et al. (2021) fine-tune several BERT models (Devlin et al., 2019) as bi- nary classifiers and combine their predictions. First learning-to-rank setups for abstract screening use non-neural techniques (Anagnostou et al., 2017; Lagopoulos et al., 2018). Lee (2017) combines sentence-level relevance scores computed by a con- volutional neural network. Wang et al. (2023c) use a cross-encoder approach following monoBERT (Nogueira et al., 2019). The first abstract screening methods using LLMs all operate in classification settings, applying ChatGPT in a zero-shot setting (Syriani et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2023). Robinson et al. (2023) also fine-tune Llama (Touvron et al., 2023) and Guanaco (Dettmers et al., 2024) to gen- erate binary inclusion labels. Wang et al. (2024b) compare a larger set of open-weights LLMs on a calibrated binary classification task. Ranking with LLMs. Integrating LLMs with rank- ing approaches is a highly active research area that has just recently emerged (Zhu et al., 2023). LLMs can be integrated as query rewriters, as dense re- trievers, as “readers” to generate natural language

fers from error propagation in the question genera- tion and sentiment analysis steps.

Existing abstract screening datasets (De Bruin et al., 2023; Kanoulas et al., 2019) provide only part of the SLR criteria. None of them provides the research questions underlying the SLRs. Prior ranking studies approximate the information need by using the SLR’s title and Boolean document retrieval queries (e.g., Wang et al., 2023a,c), or use the incomplete set of criteria specified in the SLR abstracts (Akinseloyin et al., 2024). To evaluate LLM-based rankers using the same SLR descrip- tions as humans do, we manually collect criteria and research questions exhaustively from the full texts of 57 SLRs and validate our collection pro- cess. This important dataset extension will be made publicly available to foster future work.

We propose LGAR, a novel zero-shot LLM- Guided Abstract Ranker, which directly leverages LLMs to provide graded relevance judgments. A dense ranker (Nogueira et al., 2020) then re-ranks the sets of abstracts with the same score. Our ex- periments using our new complete set of criteria and recent open-weights models for all baselines show that LGAR outperforms the existing state-of- the-art system (Akinseloyin et al., 2024) by a large margin (5-10pp. in mean average precision).

Our contributions are as follows: (1) We pro- vide the exhaustive and validated set of inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as research ques- tions for two SLR datasets, enabling realistic exper- iments. (2) We propose LGAR, a zero-shot system for LLM-based abstract screening that performs robustly across datasets and LLM families. (3) Our extensive experimental evaluation highlights the superior performance of LGAR compared to exist- ing zero-shot and fine-tuned methods. We perform a detailed ablation study for the task of abstract ranking with LLMs. We find that using large scales with up to 20 options is most effective. This differs from general ranking tasks, where scales with up to five choices have been reported to be optimal.

2The approach was also recently tested on four SLRs on the impact of climate change on diseases Sujau et al. (2025).

answers, or for data augmentation. We here focus on their application in the ranking stage, where they can be applied using a pointwise (Sun et al., 2023), pairwise (Qin et al., 2024), or listwise approach (Tang et al., 2024). The latter two are inefficient for long candidate lists, which is usually the case in abstract screening. In pointwise ranking, the generation likelihood of the query given the docu- ment can be used as relevance score (Sachan et al., 2022), or the LLM can be prompted to generate a relevance score (Liang et al., 2023). Zhuang et al. (2024) show that adding intermediate relevance op- tions can improve ranking performance over binary setups. As abstract screening queries are long and complex, we turn to relevance generation.

view 2019 (TAR2019) dataset (Task 2) (Kanoulas et al., 2019).3 Both datasets are in English and provide the title of each SLR and a set of papers labeled with binary relevance judgments.4 Table 1 gives an overview of the corpus statistics. The in- clusion rate specifies the percentage of abstracts included in the SLR out of the original candidate set retrieved using Boolean queries. The majority of SLRs address topics in medicine.

3.1 Extension with Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria and Research Questions

For SLRs, inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as research questions are specified explicitly as a basis for decision making. Akinseloyin et al. (2024) use the criteria section from the structured abstracts (but no research questions) for TAR2019. However, the full set of criteria and research questions is not always spelled out comprehensively in the SLR’s abstract (e.g., it is not the case for SYNERGY).

To the best of our knowledge, the only exist- ing ranking approach for abstract screening us- ing LLMs (Akinseloyin et al., 2024) uses a QA setup. For each inclusion/exclusion criterion, a question is generated using ChatGPT, and the LLM is prompted to answer them for each paper. An- swers are converted to numerical scores based on whether a BART (Lewis et al., 2020) model trained on sentiment analysis assigns Positive (1), Neutral (0.5), or Negative (0). The final score for each paper is computed by averaging these scores with embedding similarities of the questions, the orig- inal criteria, and the abstract. Akinseloyin et al. (2024) report that while promising, their pipeline- based approach suffers from error propagation. Our own system, LGAR, uses a more effective combina- tion of zero-shot LLM-based pointwise relevance generation and monoT5-based re-ranking.

To provide the models with a realistic evaluation setup, which can be reproduced and re-used by fu- ture work, we manually retrieve the inclusion and exclusion criteria and research questions from the full texts of all 57 SLRs of both datasets. If the review itself does not explicitly mention research questions, we infer them from its objectives or ex- tract them from the review protocols which are provided for the TAR2019 dataset. We focus on primary research questions and objectives. Some SLRs also provide sub-questions and secondary objectives. We do not extract these because they are not typically defined at the start of the abstract screening phase, but more often during the refine- ment phase of the SLR when several articles have already been checked in greater detail.

3 Dataset Extensions

In this section, we describe our extension of two abstract screening benchmarks with inclu- sion/exclusion criteria and research questions to fa- cilitate more realistic evaluation setups. We extend the SYNERGY dataset (De Bruin et al., 2023) and the test set of the CLEF Technological Assisted Re-

4 LLM-Guided Abstract Ranking

In the full text, the criteria are often combined with explanations, definitions, and reasons for spec- ifying a particular criterion. We only extract the criteria, separating them from surrounding descrip- tive text, and reformulate them as key points. In the medical domain, there are sometimes multiple criteria describing the type of studies or type of participants. We summarize these into one crite- rion describing all possible types of the respective category. We ensure that the extracted text does not refer to other material in the review, such as figures or tables. In very rare cases, SLRs also formulate inclusion and exclusion criteria based on metadata such as publication dates which are taken care of during document retrieval. Our set of extracted criteria focuses on semantic information needs.

We propose LGAR, a ranking model comprised of

a two-stage process to determine the relevance of a screened paper, as illustrated in Figure 1. In the first stage, the LLM assigns each paper a relevance score on a scale from 0 to k, similar to the LLM- based ranking approach DIRECT(0,k) of Guo et al. (2024).

Ranking for abstract screening requires produc- ing an ordered list of potentially thousands of pa- pers. The differentiation that LLMs are able to produce is limited to the range of a dozen rele- vance scores (Zhuang et al., 2024), i.e., the first ranking step will produce many ties. We hence produce the global ranking by additionally ranking the papers within each set of papers that have ob- tained the same relevance score by the LLM using a zero-shot dense ranking model. Our proposed two-stage ranker is modular, providing for modular combinations of LLMs and dense rankers.

3.2 Validation

The extraction of criteria and research questions for all SLRs was performed by the first author of this paper. We validate the extracted information on 15 randomly selected SLRs (5 SLRs from each the SYNERGY, DTA and Intervention dataset). The second author of this paper extracted the criteria and research questions with the same protocol with- out prior inspection of the data extracted by the first author. We align the extracted criteria and research questions using the cosine similarities of their BERT embeddings and then verify manually whether they indeed correspond to each other.

4.1 Graded Relevance Judgments by LLM

In the first ranking stage, the LLM is prompted with the SLR’s criteria, as well as research questions (shown in Figure 2). The general instruction en- coded in the system message suggests that a paper should only be considered relevant if all inclusion criteria but none of the exclusion criteria are met. The method is configurable to use different prompt- ing techniques, but the key elements remain the same. The system message provides the title and research questions of the SLR and the associated ranking task, in addition to a definition of relevance in the context of the SLR. The user message con- tains a more specific task description, instructing the LLM to determine a degree of relevance in the form of assigning a score from a Likert scale using the provided selection criteria, and to answer in a predefined format. It also provides the title and the abstract of the paper. Prompting Techniques. LLM responses are highly dependent on the type of prompt used (Brown et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023d). There- fore, we test several different prompting techniques, i.e., zero-shot, Chain of Thought (CoT), and CoT with self-consistency (n=3). We also tried 2-shot variants without observing any improvements (see Appendix A.4). In self-consistency setups, the rele- vance scores of each paper are averaged over three runs. For CoT prompting, we instruct the model to “think step by step” (Kojima et al., 2022).

For the 15 SLRs in our validation study, the first and second author each extracted 23 research questions, which matched exactly. This high inter- rater agreement stems from the structured nature of medical and computer science SLRs, which often present a section titled “Objectives” or explicitly state research questions, which allows straightfor- ward extraction. Incidentally, each author extracted 99 inclusion/exclusion criteria, of which 97 match. Disagreements can be narrowed down to one au- thor including more details to an criterion than the other one or including/neglecting a criterion that was not mentioned explicitly as criterion but de- scribed as important factor in the review process. Overall, we include that inclusion/exclusion cri- teria and research questions have been extracted reliably for our extension of the SYNERGY and CLEF TAR2019 datasets.

our newly constructed benchmark. In this section, we describe our experimental design, including our selection of models, our choice of evaluation metrics, and the baselines. We then present our experimental results, followed by several ablation studies.

System Message: You are a researcher conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) with the title ’{title}’. The review aims to answer the following research questions: ’{research_questions}’ Your task is to decide how relevant the provided paper is to the review, given a list of criteria. A paper is relevant if all inclusion criteria but none of the exclusion criteria are met. User Message: Task: You will be presented with a paper’s title and abstract. Your task is to decide how relevant the given paper is to the review. Return a number for your decision ranging from ’{relevance_lower_value}’ to ’{relevance_upper_value}’, where ’{rele- vance_lower_value}’ means that you are absolutely sure that the paper should be excluded, where ’{relevance_upper_value}’ means that you are absolutely sure that the paper should be included, and where an intermediate value means that you are unsure. Please read the title and the abstract carefully and then make your decision based on the provided inclusion and exclusion criteria. Title: ‘{title_paper}’ Abstract: ‘{abstract}’ Inclusion criteria: ‘{inclusion_criteria}’ Exclusion criteria: ‘{exclusion_criteria}’ Give your answer in the following format: “‘Decision: {relevance_lower_value} - {relevance_upper_value}“‘

5.1 Model Selection and Experimental Settings

To enhance the reproducibility of our results, our model selection of instruction-following LLMs is constrained to open-weights alternatives. We focus on Llama3.3-70B-Instruct (Dubey et al., 2024), which is one of the best performing open- weights models for its size at the time of writ- ing. To assess the extent of performance dispar- ities among diverse model families and varying model sizes, we conduct comparative analyses with the following models: Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct,5 Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct,6


> **Figure 2: Zero-shot prompts used in LGAR.**

Output Parsing. To make the responses as de- terministic and reproducible as possible, we use a temperature of 0. The scores are extracted using regular expression and we verify that they are in the desired relevance scale. If score extraction fails, and when using self-consistency, the temperature is set to 0.5 to encourage more diverse results. In the rare case that the LLM does not respond in the expected format, the request is repeated up to three times, without providing the model’s previous faulty response. If the response is still not in the expected format, the paper is assigned the average of the sum of all LLM generated relevance scores for the respective SLR.

and Mistral-Large-Instruct-2411 (123B).7 We run all models using 16-bit quantization.

We report test results on the entire SYNERGY dataset (which does not provide any training data), and on the test portion of the TAR2019 dataset.8 To develop LGAR, we performed prompt-engineering using Llama3.3-70B-Instruct in interactive experi- ments using SLRs taken from an additional dataset in the medical domain (Guo et al., 2023) (see Ap- pendix A.1 in particular for the exploration of dif- ferent scale sizes) and one unpublished SLR. We also run the zero-shot dense rankers on our tuning data, identifying monoT5 (Nogueira et al., 2020) in the 3B variant as most effective (also see Appendix A.1). In our ablation tests, we additionally evaluate monoBERT (large) (Nogueira and Cho, 2019) and ColBERTv2 (Santhanam et al., 2022).

4.2 Neural Dense Re-Ranking

In the second stage, we re-rank the papers within the groups generated by the LLM with neural dense retrievers backboned by pretrained language models such as monoBERT (Nogueira and Cho, 2019) or ColBERT (Khattab and Zaharia, 2020). These cross- and bi-encoders based on BERT still rank among the state-of-the-art for re-ranking tasks. Each query-document pair is the concatenation of the query followed by the title and abstract of the paper in question, truncated to 512 wordpiece to- kens. As query, we use (1) only the SLR’s title following Wang et al. (2023c) or (2) the title and the research questions of the SLR. We use neural re-rankers that were fine-tuned on the general re- trieval dataset MS MARCO (Nguyen et al., 2016), but not specifically tuned for abstract screening.

5.2 Evaluation Metrics

We adopt the evaluation metrics of the CLEF TAR

2019 challenge (Kanoulas et al., 2019): mean av- erage precision (MAP), recall at k% of top-ranked abstracts (R@k%, k = 1, 5, 10, 20, 50), and work

We use the train split of 100 additional SLRs to replicate the fine-tuning of BERT-based models for comparing different model types.

by first computing recall scores per SLR, and then macro-averaging over the obtained scores.

5.3 Baselines

WSS@r% = TN + FN

N −(1 −r) (1)

As non-neural information retrieval baseline, we provide the results of Okapi BM25 (Robertson and Zaragoza, 2009). We also report the results of monoT5, which is similar to the zero-shot model of Wang et al. (2023c) that uses BERT-base.

WSS aims to estimate the reduction in human screening workload for a given recall level. How- ever, it has some drawbacks, such as that its value range depends on the inclusion rate of the respec- tive SLR, making comparisons across multiple SLRs unfair (Kusa et al., 2023). Therefore, we additionally provide the min-max normalized ver- sion of WSS proposed by Kusa et al. (2023), which mitigates these issues and reports the True Negative Rate at recall level r:

The closest existing work to ours is that of Akinseloyin et al. (2024), who use a QA setup and (except for a small case study) ChatGPT. For a fair comparison, we replicate the GPT_QA_Soft_Both_ReRank variant of their model (which also uses selection criteria for each SLR) using Llama3.3-70B-Instruct and the embed- dings proposed by Wang et al. (2024a) (instead of the closed-source embeddings they use). To in- crease reproducibility, we use a temperature of 0 instead of 0.2 as in the original work. Our repli- cation outperforms their scores provided for the TAR2019 dataset on all metrics except WSS (which is a somewhat unreliable metric and only reported for comparison with prior work). Detailed scores are provided in Appendix A.2.

nWSS@r% = TNR@r% = TN TN + FP (2)

To compute results, we use the evaluation scripts provided in CLEF TAR 2018 with one adaptation: we found that they compute the average recall of multiple SLRs using micro-averaging:

P

{SLRs} TP P

{SLRs}(TP + FN) (3)

R@k% =

This gives more weight to larger SLRs or SLRs with a higher inclusion rate. To obtain a more realistic estimate of performance for an unseen SLR, we instead follow Akinseloyin et al. (2024)

(title-only) as re-ranker with our baselines. On both the SYNERGY and the TAR2019 datasets, zero- shot monoT5 using only the title as query outper- forms BM25 that compares the titles and abstracts of each paper to the title and research questions of the SLR. For reasons explained in section 5.2, we focus on TNR instead of WSS when interpreting our results. Overall, LGAR achieves the strongest performance over all models, outperforming the QA-based model of Akinseloyin et al. (2024) by a large margin. Impact of dense re-ranking. Our ablation remov- ing monoT5, randomly ranking the papers within each set, shows that in terms of MAP, the dif- ference is small for SYNERGY and negliglible for TAR2019, which is somewhat expected as the LLM-based relevance judgment defines the over- all order of the ranking. Nevertheless, the dense re-ranker contributes to workload savings by mov- ing up articles that were incorrectly assigned a low relevance score by the LLM, which is particularly highlighted by the the strong increase of around 7-12% in TNR. Similarly, LGAR profits from hav- ing access to the SLR’s research questions (this difference is more pronounced on SYNERGY). Comparison to QA-based system. LGAR (T, monoT5) and the QA model of Akinseloyin et al. (2024) (ours) differ with respect to model architec- ture and prompts, yet both receive exactly the same information about the SLR and the papers. Even in this setting (without using research questions), LGAR outperforms the QA model, showing that the performance increase is not merely due to addi- tional information in the prompt but due to model architecture. However, given that the research ques- tions should be available at the stage of abstract screening when conducting an SLR and that adding them appears to enhance the performance of our approach, it seems reasonable to make use of them. CoT prompting. Instructing the model to think step by step does not improve the performance of LGAR. Using self-consistency to make up for erro- neous runs improves the situation in particular for SYNERGY, but does not lead to any performance improvements over standard LGAR. Detailed in- formation can be found in Appendix A.4.

Overall, LGAR (which was developed for Llama-

5.5.2 Impact of scale size We here conduct a principled analysis of various

choices for scales. Figure 3 reports the perfor- mance of LGAR using several different scale sizes. Zhuang et al. (2024) found that for general ranking tasks, 0-4 worked best. By contrast, for our com- plex ranking task, it is beneficial to increase the scale size even further. In terms of workload sav- ings, 0-14 performs best, while the best ranking is produced by 0-19. Increasing the scale size beyond 0-19 does not further enhance the performance. In- terestingly, this replicates our initial findings on

The average number of papers ending up in one group is smallest for 0-19, which means in the 0-19 setting, the LLM takes over most ranking workload compared to other settings.

using the framework of Gao et al. (2021) and the training splits for the Intervention and DTA subset of TAR2019 (there is no training data for the rest of TAR2019 and for SYNERGY). Our zero-shot LGAR model outperforms the fine-tuned model by 7-10pp. in terms of MAP (see Table 4).

5.5.3 Effectiveness of dense rankers

5.5.5 Performance distribution across SLRs

In Table 4, we compare the performance of BM25 with that of three zero-shot dense rankers (with- out using the LLM step) using two different queries: title-only (T) and title and research ques- tions (T+R). Details are reported in the Appendix A.1. On both the SYNERGY and the TAR2019 dataset, the best configuration by far uses monoT5 with only the title as query. While BM25 and monoBERT can deal with the longer input query (T+R), the performance of ColBERT and monoT5 degrades over only using the title.


> **Figure 6 compares the distribution of MAP scores**

> achieved by LGAR with that by our replication of
the approach of Akinseloyin et al. (2024) on both
datasets. MAP scores differ greatly between SLRs,
which is due to their very different inclusion rates.
LGAR appears to have an even greater range of
scores due to its higher peak MAP scores. Overall,
LGAR achieves at least the same performance as
the QA-based approach, with a clear tendency to
be better.

6 Discussion and Outlook

5.5.4 Comparison to fine-tuned model

To put LGAR’s strong zero-shot performance into perspective, we compare it to the fine-tuned model

Our results suggest that LLMs are very effective in interpreting inclusion and exclusion criteria for

## abstract screening. They provide a good initial cat-

egorization. Re-ranking is particularly effective for
finding relevant papers accidentally categorized as
irrelevant by the LLM, thus significantly contribut-
ing to workload savings.


## abstract screening, may not contain the necessary

information. Despite this minor approximation, the
SYNERGY and the TAR2019 datasets nevertheless
provide suitable benchmarks for automatic abstract
screening methods, an assumption that we share
with prior work (Akinseloyin et al., 2024; Wang
et al., 2023c,a, 2024b).

Compared to the approach of Akinseloyin et al. (2024), it does not seem necessary to split the crite- ria into several parts, which significantly reduces the number of LLM requests. At the same time, LGAR is less “explainable” than models evaluat- ing every criterion separately. We hypothesize that LGAR performs more robustly precisely because it is not forced to evaluate each criterion separately, which likely introduces many noisy scores in the QA-based model. For many criteria, the abstract may not contain sufficient information to allow a meaningful assessment. The QA-based baseline is supposed to generate Neutral in such cases, yet, detecting when information is insufficient to an- swer a question is yet a difficult task for LLMs (Ji et al., 2022; Gautam et al., 2023). In future work, it would be interesting to further support the human user by identifying the criteria that led to including or excluding a paper.

Another limitation of the evaluation is that even though the evaluation was conducted with 57 dif- ferent SLRs, the approach could only be tested mainly in the medical domain. This is due to the composition of the datasets that are widely used when evaluating automation methods for SLRs. Al- though other domains are represented in the SYN- ERGY dataset, we believe that the number of SLRs for these respective domains is too small to give a thorough answer to the question of whether the performance of the approach is equivalent to that in the medical domain.

In addition, since many of these SLRs were pub- lished several years ago, some of their data may have already been exposed to the LLMs in their training. Hence, we can not exclude the possibility of data contamination.

Furthermore, since LLMs can perpetuate and amplify biases present in the training data, LGAR may inadvertently reinforce these biases when rank- ing abstracts. This could lead to certain research being unfairly prioritized or overlooked, potentially skewing the outcomes of SLRs. Risks. When using this approach in conducting an SLR, the main risk is to overlook a paper that is relevant to the research questions being addressed in the SLR. Missing a relevant paper is problematic when writing an SLR, which can happen when defining a cut-off in the ranked list when applying LGAR to the abstract screening stage of an SLR. However, we argue that this risk is also present when this is done manually, since manual screening of hundreds or thousands of papers is also error- prone.

7 Conclusion

In this paper, we have proposed LGAR, a novel LLM-Guided Abstract Ranker for SLRs. LGAR is based entirely on zero-shot open-weights models, yet outperforms models specifically tuned for this task. We contribute a dataset extension of exhaus- tively extracted criteria and research questions and compare to baselines in a fair way, using the same backbones and inputs, finding that LGAR performs best on two abstract screening datasets.

Limitations

The SYNERGY and TAR2019 datasets have been created based on actual SLRs, i.e., the set of rele- vant papers has been extracted from the SLRs’ bib- liographies. Hence, strictly speaking, both datasets that we use in this study provide relevance labels that correspond to the full text screening stage. Yet, as redistributing the full text of scientific publica- tions is not generally possible due to license restric- tions, both datasets only provide titles and abstracts of the papers. Hence, it is theoretically possible that some papers were still included after the ab- stract screening stage of an SLR, but excluded in the full text screening stage. In these cases, the title and abstract of the paper, which are the basis for

A.2 Detailed Evaluation of LGAR

In Table 7, the more detailed results of the main findings presented in this work are shown. Here, we report separately the results of all four splits with different medical topics of the TAR2019 dataset. In the main evaluation, the averaged results of all SLRs of TAR2019 are reported in order to keep the table clear. It is worth noting that the splits shown in this table are not equal in size, e.g., the Interven- tion split includes 20 SLRs, while the Prognosis split includes only one SLR.

A.1 Initial Interactive Tuning of LGAR

In Table 5, the results of preliminary experiments are shown. These experiments were performed on the dataset provided by Guo et al. (2023), which consists of 11 medical SLRs with a total of about 50000 papers. We excluded the SLR aiha from our evaluation because the provided dataset did not contain any relevant papers. By not using our test sets, i.e., the SYNERGY and TAR2019 dataset, for the initial optimization of our approach, we aimed to make our results more realistic since we did not optimize our approach on these test sets. We also refrained from using the train set of the

performs best on most metrics for the TAR2019
dataset, which is also the trend when evaluated on
the SYNERGY dataset.

CLEF TAR 2019 dataset for the initial tuning, since optimizing on this dataset, which is quite similar to the corresponding test set, could give our approach an unfair advantage. Therefore, we decided to use the dataset of Guo et al. (2023), which focuses on different medical topics. Another reason for using this dataset for the initial tuning was that it is rarely used by other publications, so we wouldn’t have any baselines to compare ourselves to on the dataset anyway.


> **Table 9 shows the results of using different**

> scales on the SYNERGY and TAR2019 datasets.
The results confirm our choice to use the 0-19
scale, which was identified as one of the best per-
forming scales in preliminary experiments (see Ta-
ble 5). Figure 7 depicts the distribution of rele-
vance scores on the relevance scale averaged over
all SLRs. Most papers receive a score of 0, which is
expected, since most of the papers retrieved as can-
didates from scientific databases are not relevant to
the respective SLR.

The results of using different scales on this dataset (see Table 5) suggest that increasing the scale size significantly improves performance up to scale 0-14. The scale 0-19 performs only slightly worse, while further increasing the scale size does not improve performance. Since 0-19 still performs quite well, e.g., in terms of MAP, we decided to use this scale size for our main evaluation, thus giving the LLM as many degrees of freedom as possible without compromising performance.

Similarly, in preliminary experiments when us- ing the dataset presented in Guo et al. (2023), we also investigate the performance of different dense rankers that are used in the second stage of LGAR (see Table 6). While monoT5 with title and re- search questions as query achieves the best rank- ing performance, using monoT5 with title-only as query significantly improves performance af- ter screening about 20% of the papers, resulting in a better performance on the metrics regarding potential workload savings. Therefore, we decided to use this configuration as our dense ranker for our main evaluation. The results of these subsequent experiments confirmed our choice to use monoT5 with title-only as the query (see Table 10).

(for instances labeled as relevant in the original dataset), that exhibit the expected format, i.e., the decision of the model can be extracted using reg- ular expressions. We then select one positive and one negative example from these sets randomly and remove them from the evaluation sets.

A.4 2-shot Experiments

Since previous research on LLMs has shown that adding examples to the prompts can be beneficial to their performance (Brown et al., 2020), we test the few-shot setting for the sake of completeness: admittedly, each paper can be considered irrele- vant/relevant due to various aspects of the selec- tion criteria, i.e., it is an extremely difficult task to generate examples that are representative for all irrelevant/relevant papers.

In Table 11, we compare the performance of 0- shot prompting with 2-shot, 2-shot CoT, and 2-shot CoT with self-consistency. The results suggest that adding examples does not improve the performance of LGAR, and in fact it is harmful. The reason for this could be that the randomly chosen examples are not representative of all irrelevant/relevant pa- pers. Furthermore, since the examples are gener- ated by the LLM, they could also contain reasoning errors. This could be improved by having domain experts generate the examples. However, the chal- lenge of finding good representatives for an SLR remains. Therefore, we did not pursue the use of few-shot examples.

All abstract screening datasets provide binary rel- evance labels, yet we work with assigning graded relevance judgments ranging from 0 to k. We use only two examples (one positive and one negative) for few-shot prompting. In the prompt, the positive example is always followed by the negative exam- ple. In practice, a domain expert could provide these examples together with a formulation of the reasoning they applied. As an approximation, we select the few-shot examples from zero-shot runs of the respective prompting technique, i.e., our default prompt or CoT prompt, for each SLR as follows. We select the set of examples to which the zero-
