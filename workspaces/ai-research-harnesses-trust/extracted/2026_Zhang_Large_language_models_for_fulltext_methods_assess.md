## ABSTRACT:

Systematic reviews are crucial for synthesizing scientific evidence but remain labor-intensive, 
especially when extracting detailed methodological information. Large language models (LLMs) 
offer potential for automating methodological assessments, promising to transform evidence 
synthesis. Here, using causal mediation analysis as a representative methodological domain, 
we benchmarked state-of-the-art LLMs against expert human reviewers across 180 full-text 
scientific articles. Model performance closely correlated with human judgments (accuracy 
correlation 0.71; F1 correlation 0.97), achieving near-human accuracy on straightforward, 
explicitly stated methodological criteria. However, accuracy sharply declined on complex, 
inference-intensive assessments, lagging expert reviewers by up to 15%. Errors commonly 
resulted from superficial linguistic cues—for instance, models frequently misinterpreted 
keywords like “longitudinal” or “sensitivity” as automatic evidence of rigorous methodological 
approaches—leading to systematic misclassifications. Longer documents yielded lower model 
accuracy, whereas publication year showed no significant effect. Our findings highlight an 
important pattern for practitioners using LLMs for methods review and synthesis from full texts: 
current LLMs excel at identifying explicit methodological features but require human oversight 
for nuanced interpretations. Integrating automated information extraction with targeted expert 
review thus provides a promising approach to enhance efficiency and methodological rigor in 
evidence synthesis across diverse scientific fields.


## Introduction

Systematic reviews are widely considered the gold standard in evidence-based medicine, but  conducting them takes considerable time and specialized knowledge. The rigorous process of  comprehensively screening thousands of citations, evaluating each study's quality, and  synthesizing findings can delay the translation of critical evidence into practice for years [1–3].  This challenge is especially pronounced in methodology reviews, such as those examining the  use of statistical methods in the social and medical sciences. These reviews require careful  examination of the text to evaluate which analytical models were applied in each study and the  extent to which their underlying assumptions were stated and assessed [4,5].

Mediation analysis exemplifies this challenge. Widely used to investigate how an exposure  affects an outcome through an intermediate variable (the mediator), mediation analysis rests on  several key assumptions to make causal statements [6]. These include that (i) both the  exposure and the mediator should influence the outcome; (ii) that the relationships follow the  proper temporal sequence (exposure before mediator, mediator before outcome), (iii) that no  unmeasured confounders bias the causal relationships among exposure, mediator, and  outcome; (iv) sometimes parametric model assumptions [7]. Importantly, many of these  assumptions are inherently untestable given the underlying counterfactual nature of the causal  questions, and often require expert judgement to assess. Violations of these assumptions can  lead to biased or misleading conclusions about the role of the mediator [7]. In practice, however,  such assumptions are often overlooked or only partially addressed. When noted, they may be  dispersed across sections, such as mentioned in the discussion or embedded in model  diagnostics, making it difficult to judge whether the method has been applied appropriately.

Given the extensive expert time required for such reviews and recent advances in artificial  intelligence (AI), there is growing interest in whether AI tools, particularly large language models  (LLMs), can assist with or even automate the assessment of methodological assumptions in  systematic reviews. LLMs have shown promise in related tasks such as identifying relevant  papers and extracting statistics or conclusions from abstracts; however, most existing work to  date has focused primarily on screening abstracts rather than analyzing full texts [8–15]. While  some studies have explored full-text screening and AI-powered systematic reviews, these  efforts mostly targeted straightforward features such as the number of participants and their  recorded demographics, rather than more nuanced methodological assessments that demand  domain expertise [16–18].

To address these gaps, we designed and evaluated an LLM-based pipeline to automate  methodological quality assessment from full-text articles. We used mediation analysis as a case  study and our evaluation targeted a set of methodological features with varying levels of  complexity, and aims to approximate the role of a domain expert reviewer. We built on prior  work showing that most high-impact psychology and psychiatry studies published between 2013  and 2018 fall short of methodological standards and rarely discuss the underlying assumptions  of mediation analysis [7]. As part of that months-long manual review, the authors of that work  collected an expert-annotated dataset from a completed manual review, which we used as  ground truth. We evaluated whether LLMs can reliably perform expert-level methodological

review by comparing their performance against human experts and summarizing detailed error  patterns. Our evaluation framework provides a broadly applicable template for statistical  methods assessments across diverse social and medical science domains.


## Methods

Dataset Construction

We analyzed the same set of 180 articles analyzed by Stuart et al. [7], which were selected from  the articles published between 2013 and 2018 in the 15 highest-impact psychiatry and  psychology journals (ranked by impact factor at the time). These articles were identified through  the PsycInfo database using the search term “mediation analys*”.

In Stuart et al. [7], each article was independently evaluated by two expert reviewers (assigned  from a panel of seven) on a set of methodological categories related to key assumptions in  mediation analysis. Whenever reviewers disagreed on the answer, they engaged in a structured  reconciliation process: each reviewer provided written, evidence-based justifications, followed  by detailed discussions to determine whether disagreement stemmed from oversight,  interpretive differences, or unclear article content. We considered 14 binary categories across  the 180 articles and used the documented final consensus as our gold standard labels.  Importantly, this consensus process also enables us to assess the accuracy of individual human  reviewers against the consensus standard, under the assumption that at least one reviewer  would have identified any methodological error or oversight.

To prepare the text data for computational analysis, we first retrieved full-text PDFs through  automated downloads from publisher sites or PubMed Central. We then applied a state-of-the- art PDF extraction pipeline to convert each PDF into a text file, capturing all article content,  including body text (sections, headings, and paragraphs) as well as tables [19]. Reference lists  were excluded after extraction due to their limited relevance and to avoid exceeding the context  window of the LLMs.

Stuart et al. [7], who reviewed 180 mediation analysis articles from top psychiatry and 
psychology journals and generated consensus labels on 14 methodological categories. We 
adopted these final consensus decisions as gold-standard reference labels. Building on this 
foundation, our study applied text parsing, large language model inference (basic vs. detailed 
prompts), and both quantitative and qualitative performance evaluation.

> **Table 1: Mediation Analysis Quality Assessment Criteria. Evaluation criteria adapted from**

> Stuart et al. [7] for assessing adherence to key assumptions and best practices in mediation 
analysis. The framework encompasses 14 binary assessments across five domains: 
randomization, temporal ordering, confounder control, interaction and linearity assessments, 
and methodological rigor. Each criterion evaluates whether studies explicitly addressed 
fundamental requirements for valid causal inference in mediation analysis.

We assessed each article against 14 binary methodological criteria aligned with Stuart et al.’s  study [7], spanning five critical domains: randomization (randomized exposure assignment),  temporal ordering (exposure precedes mediator; mediator precedes outcome), confounder  control (covariates included in exposure-mediator, exposure-outcome, and mediator-outcome  models; control for baseline mediator and outcome; control for post-exposure confounding  variables), interaction and linearity assessments (examination of mediator-outcome linearity;  evaluation of exposure-mediator interactions), and methodological rigor (discussion of mediation  assumptions; sensitivity analyses for assumption violations; implementation of causal mediation  methods); see Table 1. Each criterion required a binary assessment (Yes/No), yielding 2,520  total binary classifications per model run.

Model Implementation

In this study, we evaluated four state-of-the-art language models’ (as of September 2025) ability  to predict the binary labels across the 14 categories: GPT-4o [20], GPT-4o-mini [20], GPT-o3  [21], and GPT-5 [22]. To assess how prompt design influenced model performance, we  implemented two complementary prompting strategies: BASIC prompts, which requested direct  binary (Yes/No) responses without explanations, and DETAILED prompts, which included  explanations and illustrative examples clarifying the meaning of each criterion (see Appendix  A.4 for the exact prompts used). Both strategies also instructed models to provide confidence  scores [0,1] for each assessment, which we used to compute the area under the receiver  operating characteristic curve (AUC) and precision-recall AUC (PR-AUC) in addition to accuracy  metrics (see Appendix A.1 for details).

We set temperature to T=1.0 for o3 and GPT-5 by model default, and T=0.5 for GPT-4o and  GPT-4o-mini, based on preliminary testing to optimize the trade-off between response  consistency and output diversity for each model. Results for GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-o3  are all averaged over 5 runs; GPT-5 used single runs due to preview access limitations. For  advanced reasoning models (i.e., GPT-5 and o3), the “chain-of-thought” reasoning process of  asking the model to think before giving a prediction is enabled by default [23]. In a sensitivity  analysis we conducted the same experiments with two additional non-ChatGPT models (Claude  Sonnet 4 and Gemini 2.5) and found similar results; results are included in Appendix A.3.

Statistical Analysis and Error Inspection

We evaluated six performance metrics: accuracy, the fraction of correct predictions; precision,  the proportion of predicted positives that are truly positive; recall, the proportion of true positives  correctly identified; F1 score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall; AUC, the probability  that a random positive is ranked above a random negative; and PR-AUC, which emphasizes  performance on rare positive events. All metrics range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating  better performance.

To establish a benchmark of human-level performance, we assessed each individual reviewer's  performance against the gold standard labels. Specifically, we computed accuracy, precision,  recall, and F1 score for each individual reviewer based on each reviewer's initial pre- reconciliation assessments. This provides context for interpreting LLM performance relative to  human experts. Note that we did not compute AUC and PR-AUC for the human benchmark, as  these metrics require continuous confidence scores, which were not provided by reviewers in  the initial study.

To better understand factors associated with LLM accuracy, we also regressed article-level  performance on article characteristics including full-text word count, structural features (e.g.,  presence of clearly labeled Methods section), and publication year. Finally, to probe model  behavior, we examined error patterns through human inspection analyses, identifying whether  failures arose from knowledge gaps, study-design misinterpretation, or inconsistent reasoning.  All code to reproduce analyses is available at https://github.com/yiqunchen/CausalJudge.


## Results

Across 14 methodological criteria in 180 full-text articles, individual human reviewers (before  reconciliation) averaged 88.8% accuracy and 57.1% F1 when compared to the gold standard  labels. Advanced reasoning LLMs (GPT-5 and GPT-o3) achieved comparable performances,  which achieved 87.5% accuracy and 64.0% F1. Human reviewers showed slightly higher overall  accuracy, whereas LLMs achieved higher F1 scores, partly because human recall was lower for  criteria with sparse positives—such as linearity, sensitivity analysis, and post-exposure  control—which consequently reduced human F1 scores. Overall, there is a high correlation  between human and LLM metric scores (Figure 2), suggesting that harder questions for  humans are likely posing challenges for LLMs too, mirroring recent research findings in LLM  reasoning abilities [24]. Moreover, human performance also varied substantially across  reviewers: the top-performing reviewer achieved near-perfect performance on almost all criteria,  with an average accuracy of 97.7% and F1 of 89.3%, except for linearity tests, where the F1 fell  to 0.17. We present LLM performance alongside the aspirational benchmark set by the best- performing human reviewer in the main text, with results for the remaining six reviewers  available in Appendix A.2.

correlation between human and LLM performance.

Performance by Methodological Domain

Because the prevalence of studies meeting each methodological criterion varied widely across  the 14 categories (see Table 1), the resulting binary classification problems exhibited varying  degrees of class imbalance. To account for this imbalance, we evaluated performance using  both accuracy (overall correctness) and F1 score (the model’s effectiveness at identifying rare  positives). This dual evaluation strategy enabled us to highlight performance not only in terms of  overall correctness but also sensitivity to less frequent methodological features. Using these  metrics, we observed substantial performance variation across the five methodological domains,  particularly evident in the F1 scores.

Randomization (1 criterion: randomized exposure assignment). All models achieved near- human accuracy (0.95–0.97) on identifying whether the exposure was randomized, with minimal  benefit from detailed prompting. Even GPT-4o-mini attained an F1 of 0.91–0.92, approaching  the human benchmark (1.00).

Temporal Ordering (2 criteria: exposure precedes mediator; mediator precedes outcome).  Reasoning-based models (GPT-5 and GPT-o3) performed strongly here, achieving high  accuracy (0.86–0.93) and consistent F1 scores (0.85–0.88). GPT-4o showed mixed  performance (accuracy 0.61–0.75; F1 0.61–0.76), while GPT-4o-mini struggled significantly,  particularly on whether the mediator precedes the outcome temporally (accuracy: 0.34). Prompt  engineering provided only modest improvements (F1 gains: ~0.01–0.03; accuracy gains: ~0.01– 0.06).

Confounder Control (6 criteria across covariates in three model relationships, baseline  mediator/outcome control, and post-exposure control). Determining whether the model adjusted  for baseline measures of the mediator or outcome generally showed high but model-dependent  performance: GPT-5 and GPT-o3 closely approaching human accuracy (0.94–0.97), while GPT- 4o-mini consistently performed more poorly. Identifying whether the model included post- exposure controls proved particularly challenging: despite high accuracy (>0.86), F1 scores  were low (<0.37) due to poor precision (LLMs: 0.15–0.30 vs. the best human reviewer: 0.89).

Interaction and Linearity Assessments (2 criteria: mediator-outcome linearity and exposure- mediator interactions). Evaluations of linearity assumptions (whether mediator-outcome  relationships were appropriately linear) and interaction effects (whether studies examined  exposure-mediator interactions) presented significant challenges. Severe class imbalance,  characterized by the rarity of explicit linearity and interaction assessments in original studies, led  to extremely low F1 scores (<0.10 for LLMs, 0.17 for humans) despite high accuracy (0.91– 0.92). Reasoning models (GPT-5, GPT-o3) managed slightly better performance on interaction  effects, reaching moderate F1 scores (0.50–0.60 compared to 0.89 for the best human  reviewer), whereas non-reasoning models showed significantly weaker outcomes. These  accuracy-F1 discrepancies underscored the limitations of accuracy alone in scenarios marked  by class imbalance.

Methodological Rigor (3 criteria: assumption discussion; sensitivity analyses; causal mediation  implementation). When it comes to whether studies explicitly discussed mediation assumptions,  conducted sensitivity analyses, or applied formal causal mediation methods—prompting  strategies had the most pronounced effects empirically. Specifically, detailed prompting  significantly improved performance in identifying studies that explicitly used causal mediation  methods (GPT-5: F1 +0.30; GPT-o3: F1 +0.35), alongside notable accuracy improvements.  However, detailed prompts had minimal impact on whether studies discussed underlying  assumptions or performed sensitivity analyses, with only GPT-o3 showing modest improvement  (+0.10 F1).

Summary of Cross-Domain Patterns.

Three trends emerged across the 14 criteria. First, LLM performance was strongest for explicitly  stated criteria (randomization, covariates), moderate for structural requirements (temporal  ordering, baseline adjustments), and weakest for inference-heavy tasks (linearity, post-exposure  controls, sensitivity analyses). Second, detailed prompting yielded targeted rather than uniform  gains, most notably improving causal mediation identification. Third, substantial divergence  between accuracy and F1 scores on complex, imbalanced criteria (e.g., linearity, post-exposure  control, sensitivity analyses) highlighted the need for complementary metrics.

Paper Characteristics and Model Error Analysis

Analysis of paper characteristics indicated that LLMs struggled to assess methodological quality  in longer articles. Articles in the top accuracy quintile (highest 20%) averaged only 623 words,  whereas those in the bottom accuracy quintile (lowest 20%) averaged significantly longer at  3,089 words (two-sample t-test; p<0.001). This aligns with established limitations of current  LLMs, where longer texts strain context windows and attention mechanisms, thereby reducing  performance [25,26]. Conversely, LLM performance did not differ significantly between papers  with and without an explicit Methods section (p=0.8), suggesting that LLMs effectively identified  methodological details even without explicit structural cues.

We also found interesting error patterns. Although reasoning models like GPT-5 achieved the  high overall accuracy comparable to average human reviewers, most of its mistakes involve  overinterpreting weak or misleading linguistic cues. One notable example is the presence of the  word “experiment”. For instance, the model inferred a false positive for randomized exposure  from the phrase “In two experiments, we investigated the effect of social distance”, despite the  study actually employing a within‑subjects design manipulated via instruction rather than  random assignment [27]. Another example is in a juvenile-justice study, where the authors drew  data from an ongoing randomized clinical trial but only analyzed a cross-sectional sample at  baseline so there is no randomization; GPT-5 again inferred a randomized design for the  analysis [28].

Older models such as GPT-4o showed more technical misunderstandings. For instance, it often  misclassified routine demographic adjustments—such as “adjusted for age, sex, and depressive  mood”—as control for post-exposure variables, when these covariates were actually pre- exposure factors [29]. Across all models, accurately identifying temporal ordering and sensitivity  analysis remained universal challenges, as these concepts are described inconsistently and  appear in varied contexts across articles.

Identifying correct temporal ordering among exposure, mediator, and outcome proved  particularly challenging across the evaluated LLMs. As seen in other domains, the mere  presence of words like "temporal" frequently resulted in false-positive assessments. For  example, language models incorrectly interpret statements such as “both emotion regulation  and dissociation were assessed at the same timepoint (T1), and thus the temporal sequencing  of mediators remains to be ascertained through a longitudinal design” [30] as explicit  confirmation of temporal sequencing of exposure → mediator → outcome. This reflects a

broader pattern where LLMs equate the presence of longitudinal language in literature reviews  or limitation sections with an actual longitudinal design implemented in the reported analyses.

Finally, the mentioning of “sensitivity analysis” was frequently over-credited as rigorous causal  stress-testing. Studies performing simple sensitivity checks—for example, “As the cut-offs for  caseness could influence subgroup effects, we performed sensitivity analyses using alternative  cut-offs (0–11, 12–19, and 20+)”—were incorrectly credited by models as meeting causal  identification standards, thus overstating inferential rigor [31]. Collectively, these patterns reflect  a reliance on superficial linguistic cues in the paper (e.g., “randomized”, ”temporal”, ”sensitivity”)  rather than reasoning based on the actual study design and statistical analyses described in the  papers


## Discussion

Our evaluation of GPT-family models in extracting methodological details from mediation  analysis papers reveals a clear performance gradient. Models excel at identifying explicitly  stated methodological features, such as randomization and covariate inclusion. Performance is  intermediate for structured requirements like temporal ordering: reasoning models (GPT-5 and  GPT-o3) show generally strong performance but remain sensitive to variations in phrasing,  whereas GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini consistently lag behind. By contrast, models perform more  poorly on reasoning-heavy criteria (e.g., post-exposure control, sensitivity analyses, exposure– mediator interactions) and criteria with sparse positives (linearity tests). For these more complex  tasks, even advanced models struggled to achieve high F1 scores and accuracy, especially  compared to the best human reviewer. Nonetheless, overall model performance aligned closely  with average human reviewers, as demonstrated by the strong correlation (F1 r = 0.97; details  in appendix) between average model and human reviewer scores across the 14 criteria. This  suggests that while language models may overly rely on superficial linguistic cues, human  reviewers may share similar tendencies.

We also highlight the importance of careful evaluation. As in many LLM benchmarks, class  imbalance is a serious concern in our dataset: depending on the distribution of positives and  negatives, a naïve classifier that always predicts one class could achieve deceptively high  accuracy. To mitigate this, we recommend complementary metrics less sensitive to class  imbalance, such as F1 scores and PR-AUC, which provide better discriminatory power when  benchmarking models against human reviewers.

Our study has several limitations. First, it specifically focuses on synthesizing methodological  details of mediation analysis; thus, our findings might not translate directly to other  methodological domains. Second, our evaluation relied on binary labels, whereas more  nuanced, open-ended assessments could enhance the applicability of our findings to broader  methodological synthesis. Additionally, comparative evaluations of this nature depend heavily  on gold-standard reference labels, which are seldom accessible in practice. Expanding the  evaluation framework to previously unassessed methodological reviews and incorporating  exploratory (rather than solely confirmatory) assessments could further strengthen this work.  Moreover, while GPT-family models and comparably performant non-GPT models (such as

Claude 4 and Gemini 2.5; see Appendix A.4) showed similar performance patterns, future  studies could systematically investigate whether reasoning models inherently outperform others  on such tasks as well as exploring fine-tuning of open-weight models. Despite the specific focus  on mediation analysis, the methodological criteria evaluated here—such as sensitivity analyses  and temporal ordering—are broadly relevant and widely applicable, appearing in frameworks  such as difference-in-differences and path analysis, thus contributing substantially to causal  inference research across social and medical sciences.


## Conclusions

Our study demonstrates that as of September 2025, state-of-the-art LLMs can match average  human reviewers in extracting straightforward methodological information from systematic  reviews. However, they still lag behind on nuanced, reasoning-intensive tasks, such as  determining whether studies assessed exposure–mediator interactions or adequately controlled  for post-exposure confounding. Notably, even the most advanced LLM models tested remain  outperformed by the best human reviewers, highlighting the importance of criterion-specific  deployment strategies. Specifically, LLM-only extraction may suffice for simpler, explicit  methodological features, while complex or subjective assessments should involve human-AI  collaboration. Our evaluation framework and pipeline are readily generalizable, providing a  robust foundation for reproducible benchmarking and facilitating responsible integration of LLMs  into diverse evidence-synthesis workflows.

Appendix A1: Additional Performance Metrics for LLMs

We present AUC, PR-AUC, recall, and precision for the experiments run in the Methods section  of the main text (Figures S1-S4).

Performance by Methodological Domain

Randomization (1 criterion: randomized exposure assignment).

All models achieved strong classification performance (recall 0.89–0.99, precision 0.84–0.98),  with detailed prompting showing minimal impact on these metrics. GPT-4o exhibited higher  discrimination under basic prompting (AUC 0.62) than other models (0.22–0.36); this difference  narrowed with detailed prompting (GPT-4o 0.49; others 0.33–0.44). PR-AUC values were  modest across models (0.19–0.40), consistent with <20% prevalence for this criterion and  score-calibration differences; despite this, operating-point precision and recall remained high.

Temporal Ordering (2 criteria: exposure precedes mediator; mediator precedes outcome).

Both criteria showed high recall across models (0.91 and 1.00), approaching human  performance (0.97 and 0.98). Precision varied substantially, driving performance stratification.  For exposure→mediator ordering, GPT-5 achieved the highest precision (0.84, detailed  prompting), while GPT-4o-mini lagged (0.48), both below the best human precision (0.97).  Discrimination patterns differed by model and prompt: GPT-4o maintained AUC 0.85–0.88  across prompts and reached recall 1.00 for mediator→outcome with detailed prompting. GPT- o3 started strong (AUC 0.92 for mediator→outcome) but showed lower PR-AUC with detailed  prompting (exposure→mediator 0.76→0.62; mediator→outcome 0.77→0.61), suggesting  calibration and prompting sensitivity.

Confounder Control (6 criteria: covariates in three model relationships; baseline  mediator/outcome control; post-exposure control).

This largest domain showed heterogeneous patterns. Covariate-inclusion checks were the most  consistent across models. For exposure–mediator covariates, all models achieved high recall  (0.81–1.00); GPT-o3 showed strong discrimination (AUC 0.80–0.82) and precision (0.76–0.78)  across prompts. GPT-5 maintained competitive precision (0.80–0.81) with lower AUC (0.54– 0.58). GPT-4o-mini reached very high recall with lower precision (0.54–0.55). Similar patterns  held for exposure–outcome and mediator–outcome covariates, with GPT-o3 yielding the highest  AUC (0.79–0.83) and precision (0.73–0.77), followed by GPT-5.

For baseline mediator control, GPT-4o had the highest discrimination (AUC 0.84–0.90) and  strong precision under basic prompting (0.70), while detailed prompting reduced recall  (0.85→0.66). GPT-o3 was more stable across prompts (AUC 0.74–0.85; precision 0.80–0.81).  GPT-5 and GPT-4o-mini showed weaker discrimination despite high recall. Baseline outcome

control followed similar patterns: GPT-4o achieved the highest AUC (0.96–0.97), whereas GPT- 5 and GPT-o3 demonstrated higher precision (0.76–0.79).

Post-exposure control remained the most challenging criterion. Despite moderate AUC (0.48– 0.73), precision was low across models (0.15–0.37) relative to the best human reviewer (0.89).  GPT-5 paired slightly higher recall (up to 0.80) with low precision (0.15–0.17). PR-AUC was  correspondingly low (0.06–0.29), reflecting class imbalance and a tendency to over-call  positives on this criterion.

Interaction and Linearity Assessments (2 criteria: mediator-outcome linearity; exposure- mediator interactions).

Linearity showed clear limitations across models. Despite moderate AUC (0.46–0.57), practical  classification performance was low. GPT-4o-mini’s recall decreased with detailed prompting  (0.93→0.03), and GPT-o3/GPT-5 had near-zero recall (0.00–0.01) under both prompts. Under  basic prompting, only GPT-4o-mini (precision 0.07) and GPT-4o (0.09) identified any positives,  below the best human precision (0.50). PR-AUC remained low (0.07–0.16), consistent with  sparse positives; human recall was also low (0.10).

Interaction effects showed improved but still limited performance. GPT-4o achieved recall 1.00  across prompts with low precision (0.15 basic; 0.12 detailed), indicating over-identification.  GPT-o3 provided the best balance (precision 0.53 basic; 0.42 detailed; AUC 0.92 basic; 0.88  detailed), though still below the best human precision (1.00). GPT-5 was moderate (precision  0.44), and GPT-4o-mini was low (precision 0.02–0.03; recall 0.13–0.20).

Methodological Rigor (3 criteria: assumption discussion; sensitivity analyses; causal mediation  implementation).

Assumption discussion displayed heterogeneous patterns. GPT-4o-mini maintained high recall  (0.94–0.98) across prompts; GPT-o3 and GPT-5 had lower recall (0.32–0.40) relative to the  best human reviewer. GPT-o3 achieved the highest precision (0.63 basic; 0.68 detailed), above  GPT-4o-mini (0.35–0.36) but below the best human (0.97). Discrimination was moderate (AUC  0.48–0.70), with GPT-o3 showing the highest PR-AUC (0.52–0.56).

Sensitivity analyses were challenging. GPT-4o-mini achieved recall 1.00 under both prompts;  GPT-5 improved with detailed prompting (0.25→0.75). Precision, however, remained low across  models (0.04–0.33) relative to the best human (0.80). GPT-4o showed the strongest  discrimination (AUC 0.90–0.93) but low PR-AUC (0.13–0.20), consistent with class imbalance.

Causal mediation implementation had high recall across models (0.85–1.00) with lower  precision (0.05–0.70) than the best human reviewer. GPT-5 improved with detailed prompting  (precision 0.33–0.70); other models showed smaller gains. GPT-o3 yielded the highest  discrimination (AUC 0.86–0.89; PR-AUC 0.54–0.56) with moderate precision (0.11 basic; 0.40  detailed).

Appendix A2: Additional Performance Metrics for Human Reviewers

There were seven human reviewers in the original Stuart et al.[7] study and there is substantial  variation in their performance, especially when measured by F1 and precision (Figures S6 and  Figure S7). Overall, similar to LLM results, less performant reviewers struggle with both low  precision (more false positives) and low recalls (more false negatives).

Appendix A3: Additional Models

Here, we report performance results from Claude 4 and Gemini 2.5. Both models demonstrated  performance patterns broadly similar to the GPT family, with accuracies closely matching those  of GPT-5 and o3 across most criteria. These findings are consistent with extensive  benchmarking efforts showing that these “state-of-the-art” models converge toward comparable  capabilities in general language understanding and generation tasks.

Detailed Guidelines


## 1. Randomized Exposure: Look for terms like “randomized”, “random assignment”,

“RCT”, “experimental design”, “intervention group vs control group”.

2. Causal Mediation: Look for language like “causal effect”, “causal mediation”, “natural  direct/indirect effects”, “counterfactual”, “potential outcomes”.

3. Linearity: Check if they tested non-linearity (polynomial terms, splines) or explicitly  assessed mediator–outcome functional form.

4. Interaction: Look for tests of whether the exposure–mediator relationship varies by  another factor (moderation, interaction, effect modification).

5. Covariates: Verify if confounding variables were controlled in each model (EM, EO,  MO).

6. Baseline Control: Adjustment for baseline/pre-treatment values of mediator/outcome.

7. Temporal Ordering: Confirm exposure measured before mediator, mediator before  outcome (e.g., T1→T2→T3).


## 8. Assumptions: Discussion of mediation assumptions (no unmeasured confounding,

sequential ignorability, consistency, positivity).

9. Sensitivity Analysis: Robustness checks, alternative specifications, bias/sensitivity  analyses relevant to mediation assumptions.

10. Post-Exposure Variables: Any controls that occur after exposure but before media-  tor/outcome (note: controlling these can induce bias; mark as 1 if present).
