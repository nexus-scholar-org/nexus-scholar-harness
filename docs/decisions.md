# Decisions

One entry per decision that still shapes the code, newest first. The full
records were removed in the 2026-11-03 docs cut; each entry names the commit
history to read if you need the original reasoning (`git log --follow -- <path>`).

## 2026-11-03 — Claude Code dev workflow and area-based test gates

The OpenCode four-agent loop is no longer the development workflow; the files
stay, baseline-locked, as history. Development runs in Claude Code with three
project slash commands (`/milestone`, `/gate`, `/ship` in `.claude/skills/`) and
four narrow subagents (`.claude/agents/`): a read-only finding auditor, a test
gatekeeper, an independent milestone reviewer, and a UX spec writer. The
researcher approves milestone starts, contract decisions and every push.

The test selector was keyed to E3 RAG tasks, so after the one-package merge a
screening edit selected an unrelated RAG test and a search, protocol or UI edit
fell back to the full ten-minute Python suite. Selection is now by source area
(`areas` in `docs/architecture/test_gate_manifest.json`, `--changed` from git).
Inner gates skip `@pytest.mark.slow`, and the PR gate runs the full suite once in
parallel (`pytest-xdist`, `-n auto`). The full suite still runs once per PR
candidate; that rule did not change. Details are in
[`architecture/test_gate_policy.md`](architecture/test_gate_policy.md) §Selector.

## 2026-11-03 — Deployment: local engine first, hybrid sync later (option C staged from A0)

Nexus Scholar ships first as a local engine. `uv tool install nexus-scholar`,
then `nexus-scholar ui`, serves the static-exported research UI and `/api/v1`
from the one FastAPI process on loopback, behind a per-launch token. `--lan`
plus a QR code lets a phone on the same network screen. Workspaces stay local
folders, with no hosted infrastructure. AI proposals come first from the
researcher's own Claude Code or Claude Desktop through the `scholar-agent` MCP
server, which writes proposals only. A bring-your-own Anthropic or Gemini key
is the second path, for in-app runs. The maintainer never pays for or resells
tokens. The engine, UI and MCP server stay MIT. Paid features (end-to-end
encrypted sync of decision and journal events, team dual screening with real
κ, institutional SSO) go in a separate proprietary service, built only after
10–20 real users. Stage 1 sells onboarding and support, not code-gated
features. A signed desktop app (Tauri with a Python sidecar) waits for user
demand. Hosted web-first (option B) was rejected: it contradicts the privacy
of unpublished reviews and adds operations work that one maintainer cannot
carry. The full option study is in
[`roadmap/production-plan.md`](roadmap/production-plan.md) §5.

## 2026-11-03 — Brand book replaces VISUAL_DIRECTION as the UI design system

`docs/ux/brand/tokens.json` and `BRAND_BOOK.md` become the design system of
record for `apps/research-ui`. This reverses VISUAL_DIRECTION decision D1 (no
web fonts, no radius, light only). Tokens generate the Tailwind 4 theme, with
light and dark modes. The fonts (Literata, Public Sans, IBM Plex Mono) are
self-hosted, not loaded from Google, so the tool works offline and makes no
third-party calls. VISUAL_DIRECTION rules that do not conflict are kept as
amendments. GATES and the browser colour tests are updated in the same PR.

## 2026-11-03 — Production scope: Inception, Discovery, Screening over two months

Only Phases 0–2 are brought to production, on the two-month sequence M0–M5 in
[`roadmap/production-plan.md`](roadmap/production-plan.md) §6. Screening comes
first. The quality gate is a real end-to-end run on the golden UAV workspace,
not the autonomous agent loop. Everything else is labelled "not production —
parked" in UI, docs, CLI and MCP.

## 2026-11-03 — One package instead of eight kit repositories

The harness and the eight `scholar-*-kit` packages ship as one distribution,
`nexus-scholar`, from the root `pyproject.toml`. Kit code lives in
`src/scholar_<kit>/`, kit tests in `tests/kits/<kit>/`. The per-kit repositories,
vendored snapshots, `plugins.json` pins, pin codegen, installer and separate
metapackage were removed: syncing eight repositories cost a single maintainer a
great deal and bought nothing while no one installs a kit on its own. If a kit
gains independent users it can be split out again with `git subtree split`.
Contract producer provenance keeps the component names and now reports the
package version and repository commit. See the
[assessment](assessment/README.md) for why this came first.

## 2026-11-03 — Fresh assessment replaces earlier audit material as the current view

[`assessment/`](assessment/README.md) is the current, evidence-backed view of
the harness and kits, with a ranked P0/P1/P2 list. Older dated reviews remain
as history only.

## 2026-10-26 — Human confirmation is a separate package outside the frozen baseline (Phase C)

`contracts/confirmation/` and its schema sit outside the non-recursive globs
that `generate_contract_baseline.py` hashes, so adding confirmation did not
change the frozen Contract v1 payload. The refusal registry is imported, never
extended. Behaviour: [`architecture/confirmation.md`](architecture/confirmation.md).
Spec: `specs/agent-layer-portability/06_human_confirmation.md`.
Original record: `docs/architecture/decision_phase_c_confirmation_2026-10-26.md`.

## 2026-10-26 — The agent envelope is a package, not a flat module (Phase B)

`scholar_harness.contracts.envelope` is a package for the same reason: a flat
module or a schema under `schemas/v1/` would have entered the frozen lock set.
Refusal codes: [`architecture/refusals.md`](architecture/refusals.md).
Spec: `specs/agent-layer-portability/02_envelope_and_refusals.md`.
Original record: `docs/architecture/decision_phase_b_envelope_2026-10-26.md`.

## 2026-10-25 — Agent roles are generated from `roles/*.json` (Phase A)

Role definitions (`roles/*.json` plus prompts) are the source; the OpenCode
agent files are generated by `scripts/generate_agent_roles.py`. Write
permissions are derived (a critic is denied what it judges; `deny_glob` is a
write denylist; `audit/journal.jsonl` is protected).
Spec: `specs/agent-layer-portability/01_role_model.md`.
Original record: `docs/architecture/decision_phase_a_role_generation_2026-10-25.md`.

## 2026-10-23 — T-SC1 accepted without a recorded independent review (accepted risk)

PR #144 (cross-kit canonical and identifier parity pin) entered `main` without
the independent reviewer and tester evidence the gates require. The researcher
accepted that risk explicitly; it is not a precedent for skipping review.
Original record: `docs/architecture/decision_t_sc1_acceptance_without_review_2026-10-23.md`.

## 2026-10-13 — Product direction: the individual researcher

The first user is an individual researcher running a review directly in Nexus:
a local research service with a browser review interface, with CLI and MCP as
advanced interfaces. First journey: provisional protocol → bounded retrieval →
review recommendations with preserved overrides → authorized screening
decisions → transparent screening record. Full-text charting and synthesis
follow as separately validated capabilities.
Original record: `docs/architecture/decisions/individual-researcher-product.md`.

## 2026-10-12 — TD-E3-CURRENTNESS: stale extracted bodies are refused (Option B)

When an extracted body is stale, the indexing stage writes one
`RAG_INDEX_REJECTED` event and returns the typed `STALE_EXTRACTED_BODY` refusal
before any backend call or index publication (it previously crashed on an
unsupported `parameters=` argument).
Original record: `docs/architecture/decisions/td_e3_currentness_decision.md`.

## 2026-10-12 — Agent instructions must reference files that exist

The baseline-locked agent definitions pointed at two spec files that never
existed; they were corrected to `10_cross_kit_contracts.md` and
`12_execution_roadmap.md`. Backticked paths are not caught by link checks, so
such references need review.
Original record: `docs/architecture/decisions/agent-instruction-reference-repair.md`.

## 2026-10-10/12 — Authorized screening: protected publisher, restricted worker (AG)

The researcher approved a protected local publisher with a restricted
scientific worker: agents may propose screening decisions, but publication of
final decisions requires the researcher's authorization. Approval of the
direction is not proof of isolation; the
[assessment](assessment/harness-contracts-screening.md) (CON-02/03) found the
authorization still bypassable.
Current state: [`architecture/agent-controls/README.md`](architecture/agent-controls/README.md).
Original record: `docs/architecture/agent-controls/agent_controls_decision.md`.
